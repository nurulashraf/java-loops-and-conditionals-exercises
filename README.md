## Installation

To get started with these exercises, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nurulashraf/java-loops-and-conditionals-exercises.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the directory:
    ```bash
    cd java-loops-and-conditionals-exercises
    ```
3. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. If not, download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

4. To compile and run any of the Java exercises, open your terminal or command prompt in the corresponding exercise folder and use the following commands:
    ```bash
    javac ExerciseName.java
    java ExerciseName
    ```

## Usage

The repository includes various Java exercises that demonstrate loops (for, while, do-while) and conditional statements (if, else, switch). Each exercise is contained within its own Java file. You can edit, compile, and run them independently.

### Example:
1. Navigate to a specific exercise:
    ```bash
    cd Exercise1
    ```
2. Compile and run:
    ```bash
    javac Exercise1.java
    java Exercise1
    ```

## Exercises

The following exercises are included:

1. **Exercise 1**: For loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. **Exercise 2**: While loop to find the factorial of a number.
3. **Exercise 3**: Use of if-else to check whether a number is even or odd.
4. **Exercise 4**: Switch case to display a day of the week based on user input.
5. **Exercise 5**: Do-while loop to reverse a number.

Each exercise has comments to guide you through the code and explain the concepts used.
